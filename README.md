# About-me

I am a very enthusiastic full stack software developer who likes to get stuck in. I enjoy building beautiful software that is intuitive and accessible, while solving real problems and presenting data in a digestible manner.

With a background in hospotality for many many years, I have now taken the life of a computer nerd to thur. I am looking for the perfect opportunity to grow as a developer, and utilise my past experiences to deliver amazing products while also teaching my fello peers along the way.

As a fullstack developer, I use JavaScript, React, REST APIs, HTML5, CSS and Node.js, along with a constant focus on learning new languages and frameworks.

You can see all of this at work in my Github Repos. Most is my . 

Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my work, I hope you enjoy!

## Projects

Most of the projects you can find on my github are short projects, hacked togeather over a period between 1-7 days. For the most part, these were team efforts and a lot of pair programming was involved in building the apps. 

### GlassHome

Inspired by Glassdoor, [Glasshome](https://glasshome.herokuapp.com/#/) is a project hacked together over a week in a team of Seven. It is a fullstack web application that puts power in tenants hands by letting them have a voice.
